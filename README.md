# Data Visualization with Plotly
This README file provides an overview of the Jupyter Notebook code that utilizes the seaborn and plotly libraries to visualize the iris dataset.

## Introduction
The iris dataset is a well-known dataset in pattern recognition, consisting of measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species. This Jupyter Notebook code demonstrates how to create scatter plots and parallel coordinates plots to visualize the relationships and distributions of the iris dataset.

## Dependencies
To run this code, the following libraries need to be imported:
- seaborn
- plotly.express
- plotly.graph_objs
- ipywidgets

## GitHub Repository
The code for this analysis can be found in the following GitHub repository: [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kamalakarpeta/data_visualization_with_plotly).

## Conclusion
This Jupyter Notebook code provides a comprehensive demonstration of how to use seaborn and plotly libraries to visualize the iris dataset. It includes examples of creating scatter plots, parallel coordinates plots, and an interactive dashboard. These visualizations help to understand the relationships and distributions of the iris dataset, making it easier to analyze and interpret the data. By running this code, users can explore the iris dataset and gain insights into the patterns and characteristics of the different iris species.
